# Getting started

## Creating a new modpack
To create a new modpack, just run `packwiz init` - this is all you need to start using packwiz! It'll ask you for a few details, then create a `pack.toml` and `index.toml` based on your answers.

`pack.toml` is the main file of your modpack and defines several crucial details; including the name of your modpack, the version of Minecraft and the version of the mod loader you're using. Optionally, you can include a version (required for exporting to Modrinth packs) and a description for your modpack.

`index.toml` is the index of your modpack which lists the files in your modpack with their hashes (for integrity checking). You're unlikely to need to touch this yourself, but you'll need to run the `packwiz refresh` command when you manually add, remove or edit files in the pack.

## Importing an existing modpack
Have an existing CurseForge modpack? You can use the `packwiz curseforge import` command with the path to the modpack `.zip` file, which will import all the mods and files from the pack into your current directory. If this isn't your own modpack, please make sure you have permission (or a license) to redistribute the modpack you import!

!!! warning

	If you have existing files in your modpack, importing will overwrite them. It's a good idea to use version control systems (such as Git) with packwiz!
